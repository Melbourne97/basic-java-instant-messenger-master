# basic-java-instant-messenger
Java messenger for networking 1 class project

# How to run
This needs to be run in eclips, im not 100% sure why it doesnt work in netbeans, it just doesnt.

First you have to run the ServerTest then run the ClientTest after. Each will open up a jFrame with a small box towards the top of the jFrame, this is where you type your message.

# Notes
Try to keep things updated on this repository and post any problems you cant figure out in the issues tab.

Lets all work togeather and make a cool project!
